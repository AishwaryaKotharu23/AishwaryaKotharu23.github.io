About Me
------
I am an AI Research Intern at Dugree with over three years of experience in software development. My expertise lies at the intersection of Computer Vision, Satellite Imagery, and Remote Sensing, where I’ve contributed to innovative solutions across cutting-edge projects. I am driven by a deep passion for utilizing technology to better understand and safeguard biodiversity, which fuels my current research focus in Multi-Modal Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (AI).

In my recent work, I have innovatively integrated Large Language Models (LLMs), Visual Question Answering (VQA), and Remote Sensing (RS) technologies to enhance comprehensive change detection and spatiotemporal data analysis. By leveraging these advanced technologies, I enable more nuanced interpretation of large-scale geospatial data. This integration supports the creation of sophisticated predictive models that can track and forecast environmental changes with greater accuracy, ultimately providing actionable insights for environmental monitoring and decision-making.

One of my primary motivations is biodiversity conservation, where I integrate camera traps, bioacoustics, and environmental DNA (eDNA) with spatiotemporal data to create an all-encompassing monitoring system. This interdisciplinary approach combines visual, auditory, and genetic data to monitor species and ecosystem health, paving the way for more accurate and holistic insights into the state of our planet’s biodiversity.

My aim is to leverage these advanced technologies to monitor, predict, and protect ecosystems, contributing to global conservation efforts. By combining the latest in AI, machine learning, and data analysis, I aspire to create innovative tools that support biodiversity conservation and promote sustainable environmental practices.

Key Research Projects

Research Experience 
----

As a Machine Learning Engineer (Volunteer) at Omdena, I have had the opportunity to work on projects that address critical social and environmental issues through the application of advanced machine learning techniques. My role involves developing comprehensive end-to-end pipelines that are integral to the success of these projects, allowing for seamless data processing, model training, and deployment. My work at Omdena has enabled me to leverage my expertise in computer vision, remote sensing, and machine learning to tackle real-world challenges and deliver impactful solutions. Two of the key projects I have been deeply involved in are focused on Yield Prediction and Flood Forecasting. These projects exemplify how technology can be harnessed to improve agricultural productivity, enhance disaster preparedness, and ultimately contribute to global sustainability. I provide a detailed overview of each project and its significance in research tab.
