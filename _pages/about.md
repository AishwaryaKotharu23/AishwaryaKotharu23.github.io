As a Machine Learning Engineer (Volunteer) at Omdena, I have had the opportunity to work on projects that address critical social and environmental issues through the application of advanced machine learning techniques. My role involves developing comprehensive end-to-end pipelines that are integral to the success of these projects, allowing for seamless data processing, model training, and deployment. My work at Omdena has enabled me to leverage my expertise in computer vision, remote sensing, and machine learning to tackle real-world challenges and deliver impactful solutions. Two of the key projects I have been deeply involved in are focused on Yield Prediction and Flood Forecasting. These projects exemplify how technology can be harnessed to improve agricultural productivity, enhance disaster preparedness, and ultimately contribute to global sustainability. I provide a detailed overview of each project and its significance in research tab.
