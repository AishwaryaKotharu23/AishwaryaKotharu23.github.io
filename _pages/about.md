About Me
------
I am an AI Research Intern at Dugree with over 3 years of experience in software development. My expertise lies at the intersection of Computer Vision, Satellite Imagery, and Remote Sensing, where I have contributed to a range of cutting-edge projects. I am deeply passionate about leveraging technology to understand and protect biodiversity, and this drive fuels my research in areas like  Multi-Modal Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (AI).

Key Research Projects
------

- Brain Tumor Image Segmentation:
Developed an advanced classification model utilizing Swin transformers and attention mechanisms to accurately segment and classify brain tumors.

- Road Crack Image Segmentation:
Implemented a novel approach using discrete wavelet transforms and self-attention mechanisms to detect and segment road cracks with high precision.

Current Research Focus:
-----
I am currently delving into the transformative potential of Large Language Models (LLMs), Visual Question Answering (VQA), and Remote Sensing (RS) technologies for comprehensive change detection and spatiotemporal data analysis.

Remote Sensing, particularly through satellite imagery and raster data, forms the backbone of my work in monitoring land cover changes, deforestation, urban expansion, and other significant environmental shifts. The integration of LLMs and VQA with RS data represents a powerful synergy, enabling the interpretation of large-scale geospatial data with the sophistication of human-like understanding. This approach not only facilitates precise change detection but also supports the development of predictive models to forecast future environmental changes.

Motivated by a deep commitment to biodiversity conservation, I am also passionate about integrating camera traps, bioacoustics, and environmental DNA (eDNA) with spatiotemporal data analysis.. This interdisciplinary approach is designed to create a holistic monitoring system that captures the complexities of biodiversity through various lensesâ€”visual, auditory, and genetic. Camera traps provide invaluable visual records of wildlife activity, allowing for the identification and tracking of species across different regions and timeframes. Bioacoustics complements this by capturing the sounds of species, such as bird songs or amphibian calls, which are critical indicators of ecosystem health. eDNA offers a groundbreaking method to detect species presence through genetic traces left in the environment, providing a non-invasive way to monitor biodiversity in various habitats.

My ultimate goal is to apply these advanced technologies to monitor and preserve ecosystems, contributing to a deeper understanding and protection of our planet's natural heritage. By leveraging the latest advancements in AI, machine learning, and data analysis, I aspire to develop innovative solutions that not only enhance our ability to monitor environmental changes but also inform conservation strategies that protect the rich biodiversity of our planet. Through this work, I hope to make a meaningful contribution to the global efforts to preserve ecosystems and ensure a sustainable future for all species.

Research Experience 
----

As a Machine Learning Engineer (Volunteer) at Omdena, I have had the opportunity to work on projects that address critical social and environmental issues through the application of advanced machine learning techniques. My role involves developing comprehensive end-to-end pipelines that are integral to the success of these projects, allowing for seamless data processing, model training, and deployment. My work at Omdena has enabled me to leverage my expertise in computer vision, remote sensing, and machine learning to tackle real-world challenges and deliver impactful solutions. Two of the key projects I have been deeply involved in are focused on Yield Prediction and Flood Forecasting. These projects exemplify how technology can be harnessed to improve agricultural productivity, enhance disaster preparedness, and ultimately contribute to global sustainability. I provide a detailed overview of each project and its significance in research tab.
