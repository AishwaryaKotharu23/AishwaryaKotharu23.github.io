Flood Risk Assessment Using CHIRPS and Landsat Data in Sub-Basins
------
Flooding is a recurrent and devastating natural disaster in many regions, and the Congo Basin is no exception. Understanding which sub-basin contributes most to flooding is critical for effective flood risk management and mitigation. To achieve this, researchers use a combination of CHIRPS (Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data) and Landsat data to analyze rainfall patterns and land cover changes in various sub-basins.

CHIRPS provides high-resolution rainfall estimates, which are crucial for identifying areas that receive significant precipitation and are therefore more prone to flooding. When combined with Landsat data, which offers detailed insights into land use and land cover, it becomes possible to assess how these factors interact to influence flood risk. For instance, deforested areas within a sub-basin may contribute to increased runoff and reduced soil absorption, exacerbating flood risks.

By analyzing the mean indices derived from Landsat data, such as NDVI and soil moisture content, alongside CHIRPS precipitation data, researchers can identify which sub-basins are most vulnerable to flooding. This information is vital for developing targeted flood mitigation strategies, such as reinforcing flood defenses, improving drainage systems, and implementing sustainable land management practices. Moreover, understanding the contribution of each sub-basin to flooding enables more precise and effective allocation of resources for disaster preparedness and response

Deforestation Detection in the Congo Basin
------
The Congo Basin, often referred to as the "lungs of Africa," is home to the second-largest tropical rainforest in the world. This vital ecosystem plays a crucial role in regulating the global climate, sequestering carbon, and supporting an immense diversity of wildlife. However, deforestation poses a significant threat to this region, driven by factors such as logging, agricultural expansion, and infrastructure development.

To address this challenge, advanced remote sensing techniques are employed to detect and monitor deforestation in the Congo Basin. By utilizing satellite imagery from sources such as Landsat, researchers can track changes in forest cover over time. Specifically, mean indices like the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) are used to assess the health and density of the vegetation. These indices are calculated from Landsat data, providing a clear picture of where deforestation is occurring and at what rate.

The detection of deforestation in the Congo Basin is crucial for conservation efforts, as it allows for timely interventions to prevent further degradation. By identifying hotspots of deforestation, policymakers and conservation organizations can target these areas with protective measures, such as establishing protected zones, promoting sustainable land use practices, and enforcing anti-logging laws. Additionally, deforestation monitoring can inform reforestation and restoration projects, helping to mitigate the loss of biodiversity and carbon sequestration capacity.
